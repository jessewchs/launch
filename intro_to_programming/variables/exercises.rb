# Exercise 5
#
# In the first example, x=3 and there will not be an error because the do/end block
# can access variables in the outer scope.
# In the second example, the following error happens:
# NameError: undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object
# This is because the scope outside of the do/end block cannot access the variables
# created within the do/end block's scope

# Exercise 6
#
# The program is either trying to access a method or variable that does not exist,
# or is trying to access a method or variable that is not within the scope of the request.
